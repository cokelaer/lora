This is is the **lora** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ project

:Overview: Run assembler (Canu, flye, hifiasm) on a set of long read files
:Input: A set of BAM files from Pacbio sequencers, or FastQ files for Nanopore sequencers.
:Output: HTML reports with assemblies for each sample.
:Status: prod

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Lora with pip command::

    pip install sequana-lora

To update your installed version, type::

    pip install sequana-lora --upgrade


Usage
~~~~~

::

    sequana_lora --help
    sequana_lora --input-directory DATAPATH 

This creates a directory with the pipeline and configuration file. You will then need 
to execute the pipeline::

    cd lora
    sh lora.sh  # for a local run

This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can 
retrieve the pipeline itself and its configuration files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::

    snakemake -s lora.smk --cores 4 --stats stats.txt

Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.

Example 1 Pacbio subreads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sequana_lora --input-directory . --pacbio
    cd lora

**Do you need to build CCS ?**

Look at the config file and the CCS section. Check that the parameters are as expected.
If you wish to build so-called HiFi reads, set the min-passes to 10 and min-rq to 0.99.

**do you have a blast DB**

You may also edit the config file to set blast to true (you must handle the blast databases yourself)

**Do you need an annotation from your contigs?** 

Set prokka to True (for bacterial annotation)

**Want to check the core genome?** 

You may set busco to true to detect the core genome (you must provide a path to a valid lineage).

Details
~~~~~~~~~

This pipeline runs **lora** in parallel on the input fastq files (paired or not). 
A brief sequana summary report is also produced. 

In practice, you may start from BAM files generated by Pacbio sequencers or
Fastq files, or CCS files. CCS files can be built by the pipeline. Then, an
assembler is used to build the draft assemblies (Canu, hifiasm, etc). From the
draft, circularisation may be applied to generate circularised genome (useful
for bacterial genomes). Finally, each contig is blasted and quality checks are
performed using Busco, quast, etc.


Rules and configuration details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/sequana_lora/master/sequana_pipelines/lora/config.yaml>`_
to be used with the pipeline. Each rule used in the pipeline may have a section in the configuration file.
